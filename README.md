GSMCC

Description:

The code implements the Generalized Source Methods in Curvilinear Coordinates for grating diffraction calculation.
Currently available are: 1D sinusoidal gratings, 1D multilayer sinusoidal gratings, 1D polygonal shape gratings. Grating structures can be sandwitched inside an arbitrary planar multilayer structure.

Installation:

No installation is required. The project was developed in the Matlab R2017b environment.

Usage:

Add folder to the Search Path.
Uncomment the necessary lines in the file "main.m" and execute it.
